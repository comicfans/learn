as a new language , rust gains lots of attaction, there're also many projects, which historic using C as primary language ,
begin to migrate to rust (librsvg/curl/tor). The most interesting project is definitely "bring rust to linux kernel development". 
what makes it interesting does not only because it's driven by google (Google found support developers who're developing such project), 
but also due to Linus' personal taste (and maybe others) and some technical reasons, Linux kernel never accept second alternative
programming language other than C(Makefile/perl and some other DSL only used as helper script), even C++, which is (almost) a superset of C.

so first question is , why people want to use another language other than C? it's being used for kernel development for years. 
short answer is : it is so easy to get it wrong, but we'll skip this topic and foll

Linus personally hate C++, that's not a secret, he explain many times "C++ is horrible language". 

this time is no exception. if you're 
following this long kernel mailing list (https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit/CANiq72kF7AbiJCTHca4A0CxDDJU90j89uh80S3pDqDt7-jthOg@mail.gmail.com/)
which starts at 2021-06-25, you'll find that Linus keeps silent at first, but I'm definitely sure he's watch this thread all the time.
because 2021-07-07 Bart Van Assche 







, even for the most intellegent people who use it to do years kernel developing. I grep 
the kernel git log from 2.6.12-rc2(2005-Apr 1da177e4c3f) to about 5.13-rc6 (2021-Jun 6b00bc639) by
```
git log --grep=use --grep=after --grep=free --all-match --oneline | wc -l
```
got 9987 result, that means, 

There're many new launguages poped in recent years, but linux kernel development have only a few options,  
it must be no GC, low leveled, and most importantly : much better than C.
